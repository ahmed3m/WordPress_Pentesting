## Notes

The biggest challenge for me was finding vulnerabilities aside from XSS. Due to being unfamiliar with WordPress, I spent a lot of time trying to look their code to find some vulnerabilities but it was difficult to do so. XSS was the easiest to find as you can guess the spots where it can be easy to include a script to be run. It's also the easiest to detect and test using an alert message.
